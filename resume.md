## Relevant Experience

### Postdoctoral Research Associate  
**UMass Amherst**, Aug 2024 – Present  
- Designed and analyzed a hybrid, error-correction–based quantum network combining ion traps (low gate error) and diamond vacancies (high rates).  
- Integrated atmospheric-turbulence and pointing-error models (including adaptive optics) in collaboration with Xairos Inc. for an ESA modular simulator project.  
- Developed security models for quantum time-synchronization protocols.

### Graduate Research Assistant  
**LSU**, Aug 2020 – Jul 2024  
- Conceptualized and simulated a global quantum-clock–synchronization network using a constellation of LEO satellites, providing uninterrupted quantum-secure, picosecond-level precision. Led an academia–industry collaboration, produced the software infrastructure, and co-supervised two students. Authored four peer-reviewed publications (one Editor’s Suggestion), one preprint, one white paper for the NASA decadal survey (with JPL), and co-authored a successful Louisiana Board of Regents grant.  
- Developed an _ab-initio_ Markov decision process–based simulator for linear quantum networks. Implemented Pauli-channel noise and decoherence models; optimized distribution policies via model-independent Q-Learning, doubling rate and fidelity estimates. Results published in _Physical Review Applied_ (Editor’s Suggestion). Co-authored a successful MURI grant application.  
- Formulated and implemented multiplexed-repeater policies to reduce classical communication costs, introducing quasi-local distillation and swapping strategies that achieved an order-of-magnitude improvement in entanglement rates. Results published in _Communications Physics_.

## Main Projects

**Link to code:** https://github.com/stavhaldar/Quantum-Network-Policies

- **Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Network Policies**  
  Monte Carlo simulator with Q-Learning optimizer; benchmarks against Nested and SWAP-ASAP policies; supports concatenation for longer chains, efficient state-space representations, warm starts, and parallel agents.  
- **Policies for Multiplexed Repeater Chains**  
  Simulates quasi-local and fully local scheduling policies, incorporating classical communication costs; compares entanglement-distillation strategies and identifies optimal regimes.  
- **Hybrid Encoded Repeater Chain**  
  Models and simulates repeater chains using single-platform or hybrid (high-rate and high-fidelity) architectures; implements error correction with encoded Bell states via the three-qubit repetition code.  
- **Quantum Clock Synchronization Network**  
  Detailed free-space channel model (extinction, scintillation, layered turbulence, beam wandering, pointing errors, adaptive optics); simulates constellation dynamics and sync precision, with theoretical bounds and security metrics (Bell-violation tests).
