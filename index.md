Iâ€™m **Stav Haldar** a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the group of Dr. Filip Rozpedek at UMass Amherst (CICS). I received my Ph.D. in Physics from Louisiana State University in 2024. My primary research interest is the design and optimization of quantum networks. I am also interested in quantum metrology, many-body quantum systems and relativistic effects on quantum systems.
